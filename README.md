to keep an "energy efficient" external hdd awake if it's plugged in, because Windows 10 hates when drives fall asleep

simply open the source in a text editor and modify the drive letter if you want to use.
though I don't want to make any guarantees on the long-term effects on your devices, Windows 10 totally crashes for me when my drive falls asleep. So, this is better than not having it for me.
